Personalized Picks

I developed a cutting-edge fashion product recommendation system that leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to provide personalized product suggestions. By analyzing user behavior, product features, and ratings, this system offers a tailored shopping experience.

Key Features:

1. Data Preprocessing: I preprocessed the fashion products dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Recommendation Model: I built a recommendation function that uses Euclidean distance to determine product similarity based on user ratings.
3. Streamlit App: I created a user-friendly Streamlit app to demonstrate the system, allowing users to select a product and view recommended products with images.

Technical Skills:

- Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Recommendation Systems
- Streamlit App Development
- Python Programming
- Data Visualization
- Model Evaluation
- Data Analysis

Project Highlights:

- Developed a robust recommendation system that provides accurate product suggestions
- Utilized Euclidean distance to determine product similarity based on user ratings
