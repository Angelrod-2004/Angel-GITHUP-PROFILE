Executive Summary

BCG Virtual Internship – Customer Churn & Pricing Analytics

This project replicates a real-world BCG analytics engagement in the energy sector, focused on understanding, explaining, and predicting customer churn using pricing, consumption, contract, and behavioral data.

The work follows a full end-to-end analytical pipeline, transforming raw operational datasets into actionable business insights and predictive outputs that could be directly used by commercial, pricing, and retention teams.

🔍 Business Problem

Energy providers operate in a low-margin, subscription-based market where:

Customers regularly churn at contract renewal,

Pricing structures are complex (peak, off-peak, fixed, variable),

Discounts are used to retain customers at the risk of eroding profitability.


The key business questions addressed are:

1. Which customers are most likely to churn?


2. How do price changes impact consumption and churn behavior?


3. Which contract, pricing, and behavioral signals indicate elevated churn risk?


4. How can the business proactively intervene before renewal?

📊 Data Sources & Integration

Two primary datasets were integrated:

Client Data: contract details, tenure, consumption, churn labels, channel information.

Pricing Data: time-varying energy tariffs across peak and off-peak periods.


These datasets were merged at the customer level, producing a unified analytical table where each record represents a complete customer pricing and behavioral profile.


---

🧹 Data Quality & Preprocessing

To ensure analytical robustness:

Duplicate customer records were removed to maintain one observation per customer.

Numerical outliers were detected and removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, reducing distortion from extreme consumption and pricing values.

Numerical features were normalized using Min-Max scaling, ensuring comparability across variables with different units and magnitudes.



---

🕒 Time-Based Feature Engineering

Raw contract dates were transformed into business-relevant lifecycle metrics, including:

Time between renewal and contract end,

Time from contract activation to last product modification,

Months since activation, renewal, and modification,

Days remaining until renewal,

Binary indicators identifying customers within a critical 60-day renewal window.


These features capture contract maturity, inactivity, and renewal proximity, all of which are known drivers of churn in subscription businesses.


---

⚙️ Operational Delay & Risk Analysis

Process delays were analyzed by:

Calculating the 90th percentile thresholds for renewal and contract modification delays,

Measuring the proportion of customers exceeding these thresholds.


This identifies operational bottlenecks and service delays that correlate with increased churn risk and reduced customer satisfaction.


---

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Churn behavior was explored across multiple dimensions:

Sales channels and contract origins,

Number of active products,

Customer tenure,

Energy consumption and margin metrics,

Forecasted consumption and pricing components.


Distributional comparisons between churned and retained customers highlighted structural differences in behavior, enabling hypothesis-driven feature selection.


---

💰 Pricing & Economic Analysis

Price Elasticity of Demand

Price sensitivity was quantified using price elasticity, calculated as the ratio of:

Percentage change in consumption demand,

Percentage change in off-peak energy prices over time.


This analysis reveals heterogeneous customer responses to price changes, enabling segmentation into price-sensitive and price-resilient groups.

Tariff Structure Analysis

Pricing differences were evaluated across:

Peak vs off-peak periods,

Fixed vs variable tariffs,

Monthly and annual price spreads.


Maximum and average price differentials were computed to identify pricing volatility and complexity, which contribute to churn through bill unpredictability.


---

🎯 Discount Dependency Risk

A discount dependency metric was engineered by:

Aggregating total forecasted energy costs,

Calculating the ratio of discounts to total cost,

Flagging customers highly reliant on discounts for retention.


This identifies high-risk, low-margin customers whose loyalty is driven primarily by pricing incentives.


---

🔬 Feature Importance & Selection

Key churn drivers were identified through:

Correlation analysis between numerical features and churn,

Cardinality analysis of categorical variables,

Selection of the most informative features for modeling.


This ensures a parsimonious, interpretable feature set aligned with business relevance.


---

⚖️ Class Imbalance Handling

Given the natural imbalance between retained and churned customers:

Random Oversampling was applied to the minority churn class,

Preventing model bias toward majority retention outcomes.



---

🤖 Predictive Modeling

A Random Forest classifier was selected due to its:

Ability to capture non-linear relationships,

Robustness to noise and multicollinearity,

Strong performance on tabular business data.


The modeling pipeline includes:

Stratified train-test splitting,

Feature scaling,

Balanced class weighting,

Out-of-sample evaluation.



---

📏 Model Evaluation

Model performance was assessed using:

Accuracy,

Precision,

Recall,

F1 Score.


These metrics ensure the model effectively balances false positives and false negatives, which is critical for churn intervention strategies.


---

📤 Business-Ready Outputs

The final deliverable includes:

Customer-level churn probabilities for unseen data,

Exported in a format suitable for:

CRM integration,

Targeted retention campaigns,

Pricing and contract optimization.




---

🔑 Key Business Insights

Churn risk increases sharply as customers approach renewal.

Price volatility and tariff complexity are associated with higher churn.

Discount-dependent customers exhibit elevated attrition risk.

Sales channel and contract origin materially influence retention.

Consumption behavior and tenure are strong churn predictors.
