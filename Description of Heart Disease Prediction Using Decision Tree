Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling of Heart Disease Using Decision Tree Classifier

In this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis of a heart disease dataset to uncover key factors affecting cardiovascular health and developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease presence.

Key Highlights & Skills Gained:
- Data Exploration & Cleaning: Loaded data from Excel, handled missing values and duplicates, and understood data distributions through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
- Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables with LabelEncoder and standardized numerical features using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized feature relationships with histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps to identify impactful predictors.
- Model Development & Evaluation: Trained a Decision Tree classifier, evaluated its performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, and fine-tuned hyperparameters with GridSearchCV.
- Model Interpretation: Visualized the decision tree structure for interpretability and insights into feature importance.

Technologies & Libraries Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Preprocessing, DecisionTreeClassifier, GridSearchCV)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Excel for data input

This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, hyperparameter tuning, and data visualization within the healthcare domain.
